# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Data Science Projects** repository! This is a collection of various **data analysis** and **data science** projects developed using **Python**. The projects cover a wide range of topics, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predictive modeling and machine learning.

## About the Repository

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my journey in data science. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, including:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data, outliers, and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and interpreting data patterns, trends, and relationships.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding data distributions, correlations, and hypothesis testing.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing models for regression, classification, clustering, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating clear, insightful visual representations of the data using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

## Tools and Libraries

All projects in this repository are implemented using **Python**. Some of the common tools and libraries used include:

- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building machine learning models.
- **Statsmodels**: For advanced statistical analysis.

## Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder and typically contains the following files:

- `README.md`: A detailed description of the project, including the objectives, data sources, methodologies, and key findings.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis and code.
- `data/`: The datasets used for the project (if applicable).
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: The list of Python libraries and dependencies used in the project.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alimurtaza8/Data-Science-Projects.git
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebooks** to explore each project and view the results.

## Upcoming Projects

Stay tuned for more projects! I'm continuously working on new data science projects, which will include:

- Predictive modeling for business decisions.
- Deep learning models for image classification.
- Advanced NLP techniques for text analysis.
